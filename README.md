## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was done in CS252 taught at Carleton College and was a partner assignment where pair programming was mandatory.
As such, all commits were made from Rie Kurita's GitHub account as we used repl.it to collaborate on the assignment.

The project itself is an interpreter for the language Scheme written in C. It has most of the features present in other popular Scheme interpreters such as Guile. It was created using test-driven development so all bugs have been incrementally squashed as the project was developed.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To use this project, clone it into a local directory and run the make command. If you want to run tests, run the make test command. Then type in ```./interpreter``` to open the interpreter environment. If you want to run a file, pipe the file into the executable using ```./interpreter < path/to/scheme/file```.

### Prerequisites

You will need to following software installed to run the project:

```
clang
python3
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

You can use the system to run most Scheme files and commands, and can use it to practice and research functional programming.
