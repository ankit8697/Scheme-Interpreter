# Scheme-Interpreter
Implementation of a Scheme Interpreter written in C

This project was done in CS252 taught at Carleton College and was a partner assignment where pair programming was mandatory.
As such, all commits were made from Rie Kurita's GitHub account as we used repl.it to collaborate on the assignment.
